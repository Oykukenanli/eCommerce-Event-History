## Main Findings
Based on the data analysis, the following action points can be identified:

1. The disparity between the high view count and low card and purchase transaction counts suggests that the company may be grappling with a challenge of low conversion rates.

2. In the electronics category, there appears to be a significant mismatch between the number of views and the corresponding card/purchase transaction prices, which could indicate that the pricing of the electronics catalog may not be optimal.

3. In the computers category, customers tend to view cheaper products but purchase more expensive ones, signaling a possible opportunity for the store to bundle items.

4. Despite the extensive views of the lighting products, they do not seem to be attracting many purchases, hinting at a potential pricing issue. Offering discounts on these products could potentially boost sales.

5. Although CPU products rank fourth in terms of purchase transactions, they are not among the top five most viewed items, suggesting that customers may be encountering difficulties in locating these products. Enhancing the visibility of these items could be a priority for the store.

6. The sales data indicates a clear seasonality trend, with purchases peaking during holiday seasons. However, there are also significant variations in sales patterns across different days of the week and hours of the day, which need to be taken into consideration when planning promotional activities.
